# Version 0.1   June 6th, 2013 #################################################

An initial release of the optimized SFFT library. The sourcecode is based on the
original implementation (http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/sFFT/). Different
performance optimizations were applied.

  - SFFT algorithm versions 1-3 were packed in a single library.
  - The SFFT function calls were unified.
  - Some performace evaluation tools were added (counting flops, measuring time,
    etc.).

Performance optimizations:
  - Reduced Operations were possible.
  - Seperation of planning- and execution-phase.
  - SSE implementations of compute-itensive functions.
  - Optimized FFTW calls (in-place transforms, multiple DFTs at once).
  - Explicit complex arithmetic.
  - Fixed loop counts in SFFT v3.
  - Improved iteration scheme in inner loops.
  - Interleaved data layout for inner loop outputs.
  - OpenMP-based multi-threading possible when computing many sparse DFTs.
  - Usage of std::unordered_map as result datatype.
