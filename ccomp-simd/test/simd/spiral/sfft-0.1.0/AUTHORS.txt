The original SFFT sourcecode was developed by Haitham Hassanieh, Piotr Indyk,
Dina Katabi, and Eric Price at the Computer Science and Artifical Intelligence
Lab at MIT. The original sourcecode and contact information can be found at 
their website http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/sFFT/.

Performance optimizations were developed by Jörn Schumacher
<joerns@student.ethz.ch> as part of his master thesis project at the Computer
Science Department of ETH Zurich in 2013, under the supervision of Prof. Markus
Püschel (http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/markusp/).
